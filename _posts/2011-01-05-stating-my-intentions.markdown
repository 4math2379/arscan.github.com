title: Stating my Intentions
---

<p>I'm back!</p>
<p>It's been awhile, perhaps 14 years or so, since I took down my last &#8220;personal home page.&#8221;  I was a fairly early contributor to the web &#8212; I built my first home page in 1994, give or take<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://tiac.net/users/jscanlon"></a>.  It went through 3 iterations over the next 3 years, until I took it down in 1997 when I went off to <a title="Cornell" href="http://www.cornell.edu">school</a>.  Sadly, the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://tiac.net/users/jscanlon">wayback machine</a> did not do a very good job of archiving that site, and its contents are forever lost.  Sure, it was short on substance (I focused on another <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.scorched.com">website </a>that I was running at the time), but the design wasn&#8217;t bad.  And it had a pretty awesome animated 3d GIF that I made myself.</p>
<p>Since then my personal web presence has been confined mainly to a couple of <a href="http://facebook.com/scanlonr">private </a><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/robscanlon">networks</a>.  I&#8217;ve decided to change that this year, and get back to publishing out to the public web.  I have a couple of motivations for doing so, but mainly I&#8217;d just like to do a better job of recording my projects, trips, etc for posterity.  And maybe somebody will find something here useful one day.</p>
<p>Instead of aggregating all content in one place, I&#8217;m just going to link off to existing services for now.  In the short term, that means I&#8217;ll try to do a better job of posting links &amp; bite-size thoughts onto everybody&#8217;s favorite <a href="http://twitter.com/arscan">microblogging </a>service.  I&#8217;ll use this blog as a way to write up some of the projects that I have been doing in my spare time.  And I&#8217;ll also start putting more content into <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/45001949@N00/">flikr</a>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/488042/arscan?tab=accounts">stack exchange</a>, etc.</p>

<p>I went with a very simple, one page design for <a href="http://robscanlon.com">robscanlon.com</a> that is intended to quickly link people off to appropriate sites.  I originally used the <a href="http://about.me/robscanlon">about.me</a> format (pictured to the right), but decided to be slightly more original (and simplistic) in the end.  Keeping with the the general theme of disconnected services, I chose to keep my blog theme simple and completely unrelated to the main page.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure how long the current design will last &#8212; I tend to like to change site designs often.  But its as good a place as any to (re)start.</p>
<p>And so ends my inaugural post.  Hopefully it will be followed by many more!</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Rob</p>
